Danielle, Edward, and Francis are three salespeople at Holiday Homes. Write an 
application named **HomeSales** that prompts the user for a salesperson initial 
(*D*, *E*, or *F*). Either uppercase or lowercase initials are valid. While the user 
does not type *Z*, continue by prompting for the amount of a sale. Issue an error 
message for any invalid initials entered. Keep a running total of the amounts sold 
by each salesperson. After the user types *Z* or *z* for an initial, display each 
salesperson’s total, a grand total for all sales, and the name of the salesperson with 
the highest total.

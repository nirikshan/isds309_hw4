Due: Tuesday, Oct 30, 4 pm (before class)



*** Please complete the following  exercises.


Chapter 5, end of chapter exercises: 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 

(if you want go ahead and start working on exercises 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, I will assign these next week)

 
Attention

Only upload the file "program.cs" for each exercise to Titanium. That is the file that contains the code you have written. before uploading it to Titanium, rename the file program.cs to FILENAME.txt and then upload the file. (FILENAME is the name that the each exercise has provided for each program)

For example after completing chapter 2 exercise 6 (InchesToCentimeterActive), 

Copy the file "program.cs" to a new location (that way you don't lose the original program.cs file). 
Rename the newly copied file "program.cs" to "InchesToCentimeterActive.txt" 
Upload the file "InchesToCentimeterActive.txt" to Titanium. 
Repeat these steps for the other exercises.
Good luck,,

1
---
Write an application named **SumFiveInts** that allows the user to enter five 
integers and displays their sum.

2
---
Write an application named **SumInts** that allows the user to enter any number of 
integers continuously until the user enters 999. Display the sum of the values 
entered, not including 999.


3
---
Write an application named **EnterUppercaseLetters** that asks the user to type an 
uppercase letter from the keyboard. If the character entered is an uppercase 
letter, display *OK*; if it is not an uppercase letter, display an error message. 
The program continues until the user types an exclamation point.

4
---
Write an application named **DailyTemps** that continuously prompts a user for 
a series of daily high temperatures until the user enters a sentinel value. 
Valid temperatures range from −20 through 130 Fahrenheit. When the user enters 
a valid temperature, add it to a total; when the user enters an invalid temperature, 
display an error message. Before the program ends, display the number of temperatures 
entered and the average temperature.

5
---
Danielle, Edward, and Francis are three salespeople at Holiday Homes. Write an 
application named **HomeSales** that prompts the user for a salesperson initial 
(*D*, *E*, or *F*). Either uppercase or lowercase initials are valid. While the user 
does not type *Z*, continue by prompting for the amount of a sale. Issue an error 
message for any invalid initials entered. Keep a running total of the amounts sold 
by each salesperson. After the user types *Z* or *z* for an initial, display each 
salesperson’s total, a grand total for all sales, and the name of the salesperson with 
the highest total.

6
---
Write an application named **DisplayMultiplicationTable** that displays a table of the 
products of every combination of two integers from 1 through 10.

7
---
Write an application named **MultiplicationTable** that prompts the user for an integer 
value, for example 7. Then display the product of every integer from 1 through 10 when 
multiplied by the entered value. For example, the first three lines of the table might 
read `1 x 7 = 7`, `2 x 7 = 14`, and `3 x 7 = 21`.

8
---
Write an application named **OddNums** that displays all the odd numbers from 1 
through 99.

9
---
Write an application named **Sum200** that sums the integers from 1 through 200. Display
the running total when the program is halfway complete (after the first 100 numbers), 
and at the end.
